GIT Cheat sheet
1) Check last commit :
	$git log --name-status HEAD^..HEAD
	
2) Check the changes post adding, staged but not committed :
	$git diff --cached
	
3) Views changes post commits(a plenty) before pushing
	$git diff --stat origin/branchname

4) Get the changes made to a file in the recent commit
	$git diff HEAD^^ myfile (change HEAD to point to commit that you want to know the changes made to a file)

5) Show the difference between 2 branches 
	$git diff branch_1..branch_2

6) Show all the remotes 
	$git remote -v

7) Sync a file with a particular branch
	$git checkout -- theirs <branch name> -- <path to file>

8) Modify the last commit :
	$git commit --amend

9) Show the recent commit details
	$git show HEAD

	$git rebase <branch1> <branch2>

12) Check local unstaged changes,
	$git diff --exit-code

13) List all the branches in a specific remote :
